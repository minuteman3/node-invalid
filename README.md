node-invalid
============

Simple value/object validator for NodeJS.

TODO:
=====

* [ ] Describe the desired structure of an object by passing an object to the validator, using special syntax for the keys and validation functions for the values.

* [ ] Allows multiple rules to be specified with conjunction/disjunction.

* [ ] Allows rules to specify inputs and outputs to functions, validating that the function behaves as expected.

* [ ] Allows multiple rules to be chained, and for rules to be functions that manipulate rather than validate data.
